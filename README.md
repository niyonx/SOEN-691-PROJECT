## Project Type
Dataset Analysis

## Abstract
We have always been fascinated by the variety of restaurants in Bangalore. And each restaurant offers unique signature dishes. Currently there has been more than 12000 registered restaurants. And many more entrepreneurs are standing just around the corner to fill the night with more bars and restaurants. Keeping the new entrepreneurs in mind, with the available data (Zomato website data), we want to analyze which factor can be added to the success or failure of the newly opened restaurant. Some of the factors from the data includes theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. Our main goal is to analyze the existing data, convert them into graphs for simplification so that it can help new entrepreneurs to decide how, when and where they should open the restaurant to hit the success on first attempt.

## Introduction
### Context

The basic idea of analysing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea of the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurants in different places in Bengaluru. The market has not yet been saturated with the opening of new restaurants every day and the demand is increasing day by day. Nevertheless, it has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with existing restaurants despite increasing competition.

### Objectives

The objectives is to answer questions regarding the restaurants based on the different chosen parameters. 
The other objective is to help the new enterauprenaurs help deciding different paramteers to consider before opening the new restaurants and also to determine the probability of the success of the restaurants.
Recommend the restaurantbased on user's needs.
We will also try to find if there is a relation between restaurant type,location and the cost?

### Presentation of the problem to solve

Problem : For the new enterprenaurs, it's very essential to get success in the first shot due to high realty cost. 
They are also confused about locality, cuisine, rates and many more things.

Solution: First we will analyse the exisitng data, transform the data into graphs for better representation. 
On top of that we will generate a recommender system based on that.
