# SOEN-691-PROJECT
BIG DATA ANALYTICS PROJECT

Abstract :

We have always been fascinated by the variety of restaurants in Bangalore. And each restaurant offers unique signature dishes. Currently there has been more than 12000 registered restaurants. And many more entrepreneurs are standing just around the corner to fill the night with more bars and restaurants. Keeping the new entrepreneurs in mind, with the available data (Zomato website data), we want to analyze which factor can be added to the success or failure of the newly opened restaurant. Some of the factors from the data includes theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. Our main goal is to analyze the existing data, convert them into graphs for simplification so that it can help new entrepreneurs to decide how, when and where they should open the restaurant to hit the success on first attempt.
